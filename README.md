## Description
This repository is a submission for MAS Software Development Project. This project is about implementing a friction model for the
Kinova Gen3 Arm . The friction model works in offline mode and can identify the amout of friction there is between the joints of the arm 
and can predict future parameters of friction we might get depending on amount of usage of the arm. While calculating/predicting the friction 
the model won't take temprature into consideration.

## Usage
To run the main_kinova file run these commands on terminal in the project directory.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$./main

```
