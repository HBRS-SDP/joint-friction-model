## Description
This repository is a submission for MAS Software Development Project. This project is about estimating a friction model for the
Kinova Gen3 Arm.
The software can identify the amount of friction there is in the different joints of the arm of the robot.
The software renders the different parameters and the curve of the friction model, which won't consider temperature.
Depending upon specific custom applications, the user may utilize this information.

## Usage
To run the main_kinova file run these commands on terminal in the project directory.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$./main

```
